# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi I am Aarushi (she/her)! I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing an M.S. in Data Science and Public Policy Management , where I am concentrating on Artificial Intelligence Management. I hold a B.Sc. in Economics (Hons.) from Symbiosis International University and expect to graduate from CMU in May 2026.

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. Translate my technical AI and data science work  into clear, compelling data narratives.
2. Advance my existing Tableau skills and master new storytelling tools like Shorthand.
3. Apply user-centered design  and data-driven composition principles to make complex findings accessible.

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.
